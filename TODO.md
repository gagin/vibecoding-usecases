# Think about this one

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):
Format: BDD uses “Given-When-Then” scenarios to define behavior, often as use case alternatives:
Given [context] (e.g., config file exists).

When [action] (e.g., run codecat -e jsonc).

Then [outcome] (e.g., output.txt created).

Storage: Text (Gherkin syntax in .feature files) or JSON/YAML for automation (e.g., Cucumber). Example:
json

{
  "scenario": "Default Concatenation",
  "given": ["Config exists", "Directory has .py files"],
  "when": ["Run codecat -e jsonc > output.txt"],
  "then": ["output.txt contains .py, .jsonc files"]
}

Relevance: BDD’s concise scenarios complement your JSONC basic_flow and solution fields. Gherkin-to-JSON converters exist, supporting programmatic access, but diagrams are less common.

# Learnings & Potential USECASES.jsonc Improvements:
Explicit User Persona & Context:
Problem: "Developer" is too generic. We made implicit assumptions (uses Git, understands Git ignores).
Improvement: Add optional fields to define the persona and their typical environment more explicitly within the use case or globally.
persona_type: e.g., "Solo Developer", "Team Developer", "DevOps Engineer", "Data Scientist", "Security Analyst".
environment_context: e.g., "Standard Git Repository", "Monorepo (Git)", "Non-VCS Project", "CI/CD Pipeline", "Temporary/Scratch Directory".
technical_assumptions: List key assumptions about the user's knowledge or environment, e.g., "Familiar with Git & .gitignore precedence", "Has Go toolchain installed", "Running in Linux/macOS shell".
TODO: Define standardized fields/enums for persona_type, environment_context, and technical_assumptions in the USECASES format specification.
"On-Rails" vs. "Off-Rails" Scenarios:
Problem: The use cases mostly described the primary, "happy path" or intended "on-rails" usage (developer in a Git repo). We didn't explicitly define "off-rails" scenarios (running on arbitrary dirs, non-Git projects) which revealed ambiguity in default behaviors.
Improvement: Encourage or structure the format to explicitly include common "off-rails" or edge-case scenarios alongside the primary ones. This forces consideration of how the tool should behave outside its most common context.
Add a scenario_type field: e.g., "Primary", "Alternative", "Edge Case", "Error Handling".
Or, have a dedicated section/list for "Alternative Scenarios" or "Considerations".
TODO: Add a mechanism (like scenario_type or a separate section) to explicitly capture and test common alternative or "off-rails" usage patterns in the USECASES format.
Implicit vs. Explicit Behavior:
Problem: The ambiguity around default gitignore behavior arose because the need for explicit control (like target_only or off) wasn't initially driven by the core use cases, but by considering alternative contexts.
Improvement: For features with potentially surprising defaults or multiple modes (like gitignore handling), the use cases should ideally include scenarios that test the boundaries of that feature or explicitly call out the desired behavior in different contexts.
Maybe add a feature_focus field to tag use cases testing specific features.
Under needs or choices_compromises_assumptions, explicitly state the desired default behavior and whether explicit overrides are necessary. E.g., "Need: Default to Git-compatible ignore; explicit override required for non-Git dirs."
TODO: Add guidance or fields to encourage explicit definition of default behaviors and necessary overrides for multi-mode features within the USECASES format.
Clarity on Flags vs. Config:
Problem: We had confusion about whether -x should add to or replace config excludes.
Improvement: The use case format could benefit from explicitly stating the intended interaction between command-line flags and configuration files for key features.
Add a field like flag_config_interaction: e.g., "Flag overrides Config List", "Flag adds to Config List", "Flag value replaces Config value".
TODO: Consider adding an optional flag_config_interaction field to clarify how flags modify configured behavior in the USECASES format.
Summary for USECASES.jsonc TODO:
[TODO] Define User Persona/Context Schema: Add structured fields (persona_type, environment_context, technical_assumptions) to better define the target user and their operating environment.
[TODO] Incorporate "Off-Rails" Scenarios: Add structure (scenario_type?) or guidance to explicitly include use cases for alternative or edge-case usage patterns, not just the primary "happy path".
[TODO] Explicit Default/Override Needs: Add fields (feature_focus?) or guidance to ensure use cases explicitly define desired default behaviors for complex/multi-mode features and when overrides are needed.
[TODO] Clarify Flag/Config Interaction: Consider adding an optional field (flag_config_interaction?) to specify how command-line flags should interact with corresponding configuration settings (replace, add, override).
